# Employee-Tracker

## Description

- The purpose of this repository is for a business owner to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company so that they can organize and plan their business.
- This is done by having a content management system (CMS) by building a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
